[Tinytotties](http://tinytotties.com) is an e-commerce site which sells baby bedding sets and kids room decor. We ran 3 experiments for them and saw some nice improvements in conversion rates as well as revenue-per-visitor in all 3 tests. They did a great job helping us develop the experiments. It's important to setup global tests when testing e-commerce sites and their team did a great job implementing our tests.

## Test #1

**Test Page: **Product Pages

**Variations: **4

**Hypotheses:**

  * **Variation 1 (Anxiety Relief):** Addressing  concerns that the visitor may have when deciding whether to purch ase a product will decrease their anxiety level, therefore increasing conversions.
  * **Variation 2 (Proximity + Add-on Friction):** We noticed that many yes/no options were using select lists instead of radios or checkboxes, and were creating friction by making it seem like it was a multiple-choice question. We replaced these with tickers and used the extra space as a place to put our anxiety-relieving elements.
  * **Variation 3 (Head-less): **Previous tests have shown that shorter headers usually convert better due to browser sizes - We removed the top banner and moved the search box above the navigation to test this.
  * **Variation 4 (Scarcity): **We wanted to test the effect on scarcity on their visitors - we accomplished this by changing the price label to "Today Only:"[/list]

**The Variations (Click to enlarge):**

Control LP 7.01%

Anxiety Relief:**+31.91%**

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/3.5.jpg)

Proximity + Friction:**+20.55%**

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/4.5.jpg)

[Shorter Header](http://landersoptimized.com/case-studies/shorter-header-increases-conversion-rate-by-107/):**+18.74%**

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/5.5.jpg)

Scarcity: **+4.07%**

**Conclusion: **All of our hypothesis had positive results on conversion rates - we ended up putting together all the concepts we learned and implementing them globally.

## Test #2

**Test Page: **Category Pages

**Variations: **1

**Hypotheses:**

  * **Variation 1 (Larger Images):** With 4 products per row on the category pages, it was hard to see any details of a product without zooming into it. We thought putting just 3 products per row would increase engagement.[/list]

**The Variations (Click to enlarge):**

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/var-1.png)

Control: **7.01%**

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/vAr-2.jpg)

Anxiety Relief: **+22% Revenue-per-visitor**

**Result: **The Variation saw a 22% increase in revenue-per-visitor. The overall conversion rate increased 11%, which means revenue-per-conversion also increase.

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/result-300x53.png)

**Conclusion: **Visitors will engage more when product details are clearly visible.

## Test #3

**Test Page: **"You may also Like"

**Variations: **1

**Hypothesis: ** On this particular site, visitors were being sent to a recommendations page after hitting "add to cart", instead of the cart page. We wanted to see how effective this was, so we set up a custom funnel in Google Analytics. We found that the recommendations page had a pretty high exit rate - about 60%. We wanted to test the effects of removing this un-necessary step.

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/test3-238x300.png)

 

**Results**

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/fresult-300x140.png)

 

**Conclusion: **Removing this extra step increased overall revenue-per-visitor by **32.91%.**
