SecureView is an advanced mobile forensics tool used by government agencies world-wide such as the FBI, Secret Service, and police departments all around. They came to us with the goal of increasing the lead conversion rate.

After doing an analysis of the site, market, and competition, we came up with a few hypotheses that we decided to split-test. The challenge with this site is that it was not generating many leads to begin with. Ideally, you want to let a test run until it has gathered at least 100 conversions per variation in order to get accurate data. In some cases (as in this case), gathering that much data can take a while. Whenever you are in this sort of situation, here is the approach you'll want to take in order to make sure that testing doesn't take forever:

  1. **Combine multiple changes into each variation:** Although this goes against the common CRO guideline of testing "one thing at a time," this is simply not a good idea if you are getting less than 250 conversions per month. The more changes you combine in a variation, the more difference you'll have between the conversion rates of each variation. Testing a variation that ends up having a 5% lift takes **a lot longer** than testing a variation that has a 20% lift, or a -20% lift. Even if it's negative, it will be quick. So you'll be able to move on to the next test more quickly.
  2. **Go ahead and use vanity metrics as the primary goal:** A vanity metric is anything that is an indicator of performance, but not necessarily a direct measure of performance. For example, on an e-commerce site, "add to cart" conversions are considered vanity conversions because they are not necessarily sales, but indicators of sales. You can run 3 tests that successfully increase add-to-carts which will be much quicker than measuring sales. Then, take the changes of the 3 winners and combine them into a single test that measures actual sales. Because the change in conversion will be larger, running the tests this way will be quicker than if you just ran 3 different tests that use "sales" as the primary goal. In this case, we measured actual leads and did not use a vanity metric.
After some analysis on the site, we discovered that the SecureView site offered a free trial download of SecureView, but it was sort of hidden and hard to get to. We felt that this should be a more promoted offer as it serves as a method of lead generation because visitors have to fill out a form in order to get the trial. We decided to put a call-to-action on the landing page that promoted this trial.

We also created a new slider that clearly states the benefits to the user, in terms of how it will help them solve cases & catch suspects. We added some great credibility indicators by showing some major government agencies that use the product, as well as case studies that prove the product's effectiveness. The result is a doubled conversion rate.

## Conclusion

Because we combined multiple changes we won't know for sure what changes actually lifted conversions and which changes decreased conversion. But the end goal is the result, and that was attained. In any case, it seems as if the following is true based on the results:

  * Promoting the free trial on the main landing page increased awareness of the offer, thereby increasing conversions
  * Logos of agencies who use the product seemed to increase conversions
  * Stronger value propositions increased perceived value of the product
Hopefully there are some changes made here that can be applied to your own pages - now get back to testing!
