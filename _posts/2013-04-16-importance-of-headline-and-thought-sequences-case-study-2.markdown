Anti-depressants such as Paxil and Zoloft dominate the pharmaceutical market. However, they build dependence and are made using chemicals that are un-natural to your body. It can also have major side effects. Provanax aims to solve this - It's a natural supplement that not only helps depression, but it also helps reduce anxiety and stress. It has no side effects, and use safe, clinically proven Ingredients.

Take a look at the treatment below. We didn't change much, but the increase was significant. The test concluded quickly even with a small dataset. We'll go more in-depth as to why we believe we achieved these results.

## The Variations

## Conclusion

Although we've just begun optimizing this page, we've already seen significant improvement. Whenever you land on a webpage, the first thing your brain tries to figure out is "Where am I?" and "What can I do here?"  This is why headlines tend to be so important - it answers those 2 questions very quickly. But _why_ does it have to be that way? Simply because it's the way our brain tends to figure things out.

This leads me to another concern we had with the original page - Where the headline should be, there was a testimonial. Intuitively, this makes sense, as it builds social value and reduces anxiety of the visitor. In essence it's a sort of incentive. But, even when offered lots of incentives, we still need to see value in it in the first place to take action. For example, would you submit a form titled "Take a free trial," if you knew nothing about what the free trial was for? Probably not. It's a kind offer, but until you see value in it, you won't be interested.

All we did on the variation is make the page more congruent with the thought sequence of someone being introduced to Provanax. This was done by replacing the testimonial with a headline describing where the visitor has landed and what the page has to offer. The test reached conclusion quickly because of the large improvement, however, with a small dataset we can't be sure by how much exactly the conversion increased, although I'm sure it's significant.
