Primalite Nutrients provides high-quality Garcinia Cambogia to people who would like to lose weight. Garcinia Cambogia has been shown to be very effective at reducing weight and has gained lots of buzz ever since Dr. Oz featured the supplement on his show.

Primalite uses a 3-step funnel to convert customers, which looks something like this:

Article Page -> Landing Page -> Checkout Page

The article page is essentially an article located on a separate domain that reviews Primalite's effectiveness and then links users to the landing page. The goal is to generate 3rd-party credibility for their product, and increase the motivation of the visitor before sending them to the landing page. _Clever._

Our testing philosophy is simply this: _A webpage is simply a vehicle for instilling thoughts in the mind of the visitor, both positive and negative, which together determine your conversion rate. _By instilling different thoughts through messaging, you can adjust your conversion rate.

On an article page like this, it's of high importance that the visitor actually _believes _that the article was written by a 3rd party. A major flaw we noticed was the call to action, which simply said "Click Here". The issue with this is that this is not the way a 3rd party would speak. This makes it kind of obvious that the website is advertising it's own product in a very subtle way, yet enough to affect conversions.

For the variation, we decided to change the language to "Take me to the offer". This implies that the visitor is being taken somewhere external, and therefore communicating the message we wanted. This resulted in a **33% increase in orders!**

## The Variations

**Control: 0.3% Conversion Rate**

![Control](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/Control1.png)

**Treatment: 0.4% Conversion Rate (+33%)**

![](/media/images/{{ page.date | date: "%F" }}-{{ page.slug }}/Winner21.png)

## Conclusion

People tend to correlate the amount of elements changed with the expected change in conversion rate. _This is definately the wrong way to go about things._ Think about changing your prices. This does not add/remove any elements, however, it can affect your conversion drastically. CRO is all about optimizing _thoughts _rather than elements. This is why this test performed well, and goes to show how effective you can be when thinking only about what's in the mind of the visitor.

Another thing I'd like you to keep in mind is just how much data we collected for this test. **More than 57,000 visitors were included in this test.** These are not "maybe" results. This test used a huge sample size, and you can be sure there are no statistical errors in this result.

Hope this helps, get back to testing!
