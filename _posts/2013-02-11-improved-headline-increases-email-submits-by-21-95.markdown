Jumpoutthegym.com provides e-books, training videos, and other educational materials that teaches athletes how to jump higher. Jumpoutthegym.com acquires customers by email marketing to visitors who subscribe to their newsletters. Their funnel starts with an e-mail submit, and it being the wider part of the funnel, we decided to focus on this part first. By increasing the conversion rate on their e-mail sign-up rate, we were able to increase bottom-line revenues.

## Why It Won

The original headline was very unclear - it didn't state what the page offers, nor why a user should submit their e-mail. It's also very qualitative, and that tends to perform poorly compared to quantitative statements. The new headline clearly states what the page has to offer, and is specific about the offer. The key here was to get away from qualitative words such as "best", and use specific facts 7 figures such as "72 inches higher".
