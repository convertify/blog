[TheRTAStore.com](http://thertastore.com) is one of the biggest sellers of kitchen cabinets online. They have been featured on channels like HSN and the DIY Network. The page we optimized was their "pre-assembled cabinets" page, which was seeing a bounce rate of about 50%. This means that half of the people who entered the site and saw this page first, decided to leave immediately. This page is a category page, which means it simply lists products and has no add-to-cart button. In order to optimize conversions through category pages, it is more important to focus on the bounce rate rather than a conversion rate since the job of the category page is to let them browse products and engage them by showing them the products they want. After reviewing some keyword data, we found that a lot of the traffic for this specific page was coming from the term "cheap kitchen cabinets". However, the pre-assembled cabinets are not the cheapest cabinets that they offer. Ready-to-Assemble cabinets allow you to get the same cabinets for a cheaper price because you have to assemble them yourself. We figured that people were landing here looking for cheap cabinets, seeing the prices, then leaving because they really weren't cheap. We solved this issue by adding a banner at the top that let the visitor know they have cheaper options, directing them to the ready-to-assemble category page. This allowed us to keep 20% more visitors on the site, increasing user engagement as well as adding to their bottom line. We also decided to add a more prominent title, so that the visitors who actually wanted pre-assembled cabinets could know immediately that they were at the right place.
