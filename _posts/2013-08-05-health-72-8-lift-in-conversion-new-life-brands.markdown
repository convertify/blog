New Life Brands is a great client of ours who provides a range of nutritional products. For this case study, we'll be discussing a test we performed for their "Pure Garcinia Cambogia Extract" product. They came to us looking for an increase conversion rate for the sake of their affiliates. This case study details one of the experiments we ran for them which resulted in a **72.8% increase in sales!**

The challenge with this site is that their affiliates send traffic from a number of different sources. Affiliates come and go often, and when you factor in the fact that the affiliates themselves are always experimenting with their traffic, it's tough to target the audience as well as we would usually like. We decided that the best strategy was to focus on targeting the audience broadly, which comes at a cost of not being able to use as much personalization as we usually would.

Any time we start optimizing the page, the first thing we do is a competitive analysis. Far too often people focus too much on the landing page and not enough on the market. When you make this mistake,  you being asking un-important questions such as _"what color button should I use?",_ or _"Should the video be on the left or the right?"_

To get results, it's key to focus on big picture issues such as, _"If I was looking to lose weight, what are the first steps I would take?"_ or _"How would I decide what product to choose if I was comparing weight-loss products?"_ Questions like these are much more effective at generating ideas for bigger lifts, and that's pretty much what we did here.

Assuming I was already interested in a Garcinia Cambogia supplement (which we know due to the fact that they clicked an ad and landed on this landing page), my buying decision will most likely be based on the following:

  1. Price (Is this the most cost effective brand?)
  2. Quality (Are there better quality brands?)
  3. Exclusivity (Is there anything special about this brand?)
Combining this hypothesis with some market research, we came up with the following value propositions that communicated these properties about _Pure Garcinia Cambogia Extract_ :

  1. It's a 100% pure extract (Exclusivity, Quality)
  2. It's made in the USA (Quality)
  3. It contains 60% HCA (Quality)
  4. It's $29.60 per bottle (Price)
We put this together and added it to the variation. The test revealed some great results:

## Conclusion

When you have a good product, _transparency is key._ Let me use a real-life example. If I told you I can make good food and wanted to sell it to you, what's the best way to convince you to buy it? The answer is not to point an arrow at it, to put it "above the fold", nor is it to put a "trust seal" under it - _the best way is to just let you have a bite._ Sure, there are countless case studies out there that agree on certain best practices. But the best way to make something convert is to _communicate its value clearly._ And that's exactly what we did here.

Hope you guys found this case study helpful!
