## Why It Won




The original headline was very unclear - it didn't state what the page offers, nor why a user should submit their e-mail. It's also very qualitative, and that tends to perform poorly compared to quantitative statements. The new headline clearly states what the page has to offer, and is specific about the offer. The key here was to get away from qualitative words such as "best", and use specific facts 7 figures such as "72 inches higher".
